# Abstract

Examining the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) while practicing my git skills.

# Life Expectancy Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

data("gapminder_unfiltered")
```

```{r}
# find max life expectancy for each year and country which had max life expectancy

sumdat <- gapminder_unfiltered |> # using natural pipe even though I hate it
  group_by(year) |> # group by year
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) |> # filter only obs which are max for lifeExp
  ungroup() |> # so I don't mess up later
  select(year, country, lifeExp) |> # select what I need
  arrange(year) # from oldest to newest

sumdat
```
